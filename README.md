# React + TypeScript + Vite

A project developed following Rockeseat's React Trail, basically we've got a simulation of social media, where you're able to:
- comment on posts
- delete your comments

Profile pictures are static but you can change them using the link from GitHub's profile picture;
Posts are static too, you can chage them only adding a new one in the array of Posts;
